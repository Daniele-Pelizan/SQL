---> Refer to the column names along with the data type while creating a table from the ER diagram.
---> If needed revisit the videos Week 2: Data Modeling and Architecture: Creating DDLs for Your Main Dataset and Normalized Datasets

/* [Q7] What is the quarter over quarter % change in revenue? 

Hint: Quarter over Quarter percentage change in revenue means what is the change in revenue from the subsequent quarter to the previous quarter in percentage.
      To calculate you need to use the common table expression to find out the sum of revenue for each quarter.
      Then use that CTE along with the LAG function to calculate the QoQ percentage change in revenue.
      
Note: For reference, refer to question number 5. Week-2: Hands-on (Practice)-GL_EATS_PRACTICE_EXERCISE_SOLUTION.SQL. 
      You'll get an overview of how to use common table expressions and the LAG function from this question.*/
